    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
      - On macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`
7. Code Editor or IDE:
    - Recommended: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any text editor of your choice
8. Additional Python Packages:
    - Depending on your project, you may need additional packages. Common ones include:
        - requests: `pip install requests`
